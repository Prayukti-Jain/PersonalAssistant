It is a web based application. Front end is created using HTML, CSS, ReactJS and JavaScript. Back end is created using NodeJS and with a MongoDB database support.

You should have node and MongoDB installed. For the ReactJS part, I have created jsx file which will be converted to js file. For that you should have babel installed.

For running the application, first start MongoDB server. Then start the server and type: http://localhost:5050/login.html in browser.
